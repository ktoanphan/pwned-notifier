# HOW TO TEST 

From the root directory, run:  npm run build 
This will create a build version of the extension in a "build" folder in the root directory.

In Google Chrome:
- go to chrome://extensions
- Click on Load unpacked
- Browse to the root directory of the extension on your computer and select the "build" folder generated above. 
- Visit a website and click on the extension to see the result. 

Have fun! :)
